## This fork have improved these;

## 1 |
### Include Not Fount Usage
#### If you make include_not_found value false, there will be litteraly no more questions when you run rename command

## 2 |
### TV Shows Folder Structure 
#### If you add folder insturcutions in your config.yml tvshow pattern, they will be implemented (like folder creation - changin folder), just like filebot's system. For example, if you make your TV Show and Movie pattern like this;
``` yml
  patterns:
    movie: "/media/ProcessedMovies/{name} ({year})/{name} ({year}){extension}"
    tvshow: "/media/ProcessedSeries/{name}/Season {season}/{name} - S{season}E{episode}{extension}"
```
#### It will automaticly create folders that doesn't exist and move the episode or movie into existing or new created folder.

## 3 |
### New function added to prevent same tmdb id episodes or movies (for example diffrent qualities or codecs etc.) to overwrite. 
#### Now if a file name dublicates, it automaticly adds ...(1) / ...(2) to end of the file name. No logs yet, but there will be

```

## Configuration

GoNamer can be configured using environment variables or a configuration file (coming soon):

```env
TMDB_API_KEY=your_key       # Required
MEDIA_PATH=./              # Path to scan
RECURSIVE=true            # Scan subdirectories
INCLUDE_NOT_FOUND=false  # Include unmatched files
DRY_RUN=true            # Test without renaming
MOVIE_PATTERN="{name} - {year}{extension}"
TVSHOW_PATTERN="{name} - {season}x{episode}{extension}"
TYPE=movie             # movie or tvshow
MAX_RESULTS=5         # Max suggestions per file
QUICK_MODE=false     # Skip confirmation
```

## Usage Examples

### Movies
